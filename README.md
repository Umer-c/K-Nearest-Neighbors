# K-Nearest-Neighbors (Regression)
The exercise decomposes the KNN algorithm and its mechanics.

Things to discover:

-Discover its sensitivity to scale

-Fine tune its parameter K

Finally, a comparison of its performance to the one of a Linear Regression, and choosing the model most suited for the task.

# K-Nearest-Neighbors (Classification)

The dataset

Each obervation of the dataset is a numerically represented heartbeat, taken from a patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG). The target is binary and defines whether the heartbeat is at risk of cardiovascular disease [1] or not [0].

We will flag heartbeats that are at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

-We will Investigate the class balance of the dataset

-Evaluate and compare two models: KNN and LogisticRegression

-Use Confusion matrix and Classification report to get insight on the models’ performances

-Choosing the optimal model based on the appropriate metric and performing prediction
